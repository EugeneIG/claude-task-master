# Task ID: 97
# Title: Create Taskmaster Jingle Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 95, 57, 3, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a musical jingle system for Taskmaster that plays sound effects during key CLI interactions to enhance user experience.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a sound system that plays audio cues during Taskmaster CLI operations. Key implementation steps include:

1. Audio System Integration:
   - Research and select appropriate audio library compatible with Node.js CLI applications
   - Implement cross-platform audio playback (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Create sound configuration options in .taskmasterconfig

2. Jingle Design:
   - Define sound triggers for key events (task creation, completion, errors, etc.)
   - Create or source appropriate sound files (WAV/MP3 format)
   - Implement volume control and mute option in settings

3. CLI Integration:
   - Add sound playback to core CLI commands (init, create, update, delete)
   - Implement optional sound effects toggle via command line flags
   - Ensure audio playback doesn't interfere with CLI performance

4. Documentation:
   - Update user guide with sound configuration instructions
   - Add troubleshooting section for audio playback issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify audio plays correctly during each supported CLI operation
2. Test sound configuration options across different platforms
3. Confirm volume control and mute functionality works as expected
4. Validate that audio playback doesn't affect CLI performance
5. Test edge cases (no audio hardware, invalid sound files, etc.)
6. Ensure sound effects can be disabled via configuration and CLI flags
