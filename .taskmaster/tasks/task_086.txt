# Task ID: 86
# Title: Implement GitHub Issue Export Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive 'export_task' command that enables exporting Task Master tasks to GitHub Issues, providing bidirectional integration with the existing import functionality.
# Details:
Implement a robust 'export_task' command with the following components:

1. **Command Structure**:
   - Create a new 'export_task' command with destination-specific subcommands
   - Initial implementation should focus on GitHub integration
   - Command syntax: `taskmaster export_task github [options] <task_id>`
   - Support options for repository selection, issue type, and export configuration

2. **GitHub Issue Creation**:
   - Convert Task Master tasks into properly formatted GitHub issues
   - Map task title and description to GitHub issue fields
   - Convert implementation details and test strategy into well-structured issue body sections
   - Transform subtasks into GitHub task lists or optionally create separate linked issues
   - Map Task Master priorities, tags, and assignees to GitHub labels and assignees
   - Add Task Master metadata as hidden comments for bidirectional linking

3. **GitHub API Integration**:
   - Implement GitHub API client for issue creation and management
   - Support authentication via GITHUB_API_KEY environment variable
   - Handle repository access for both public and private repositories
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Add rate limiting support to prevent API abuse
   - Support milestone assignment if applicable

4. **Bidirectional Linking**:
   - Store GitHub issue URL and ID in task metadata
   - Use consistent metadata schema compatible with the import feature
   - Implement checks to prevent duplicate exports
   - Support updating existing GitHub issues if task has been modified
   - Enable round-trip workflows (export → modify in GitHub → re-import)

5. **Extensible Architecture**:
   - Design the export system to be platform-agnostic
   - Create adapter interfaces for different export destinations
   - Implement the GitHub adapter as the first concrete implementation
   - Allow for custom export templates and formatting rules
   - Document extension points for future platforms (GitLab, Linear, Jira, etc.)

6. **Content Formatting**:
   - Implement smart content conversion from Task Master format to GitHub-optimized format
   - Handle markdown conversion appropriately
   - Format code blocks, tables, and other structured content
   - Add appropriate GitHub-specific references and formatting
   - Ensure proper rendering of task relationships and dependencies

7. **Configuration and Settings**:
   - Add export-related configuration to Task Master settings
   - Support default repositories and export preferences
   - Allow customization of export templates and formatting
   - Implement export history tracking

8. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the export feature
   - Include examples and best practices
   - Document the bidirectional workflow with import feature

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for each component of the export system
   - Test GitHub API client with mock responses
   - Verify correct task-to-issue conversion logic
   - Test bidirectional linking metadata handling
   - Validate error handling and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test end-to-end export workflow with test GitHub repository
   - Verify created GitHub issues match expected format and content
   - Test round-trip workflow (export → import) to ensure data integrity
   - Validate behavior with various task types and structures
   - Test with both simple and complex tasks with subtasks

3. **Manual Testing Checklist**:
   - Export a simple task and verify all fields are correctly mapped
   - Export a complex task with subtasks and verify correct representation
   - Test exporting to different repositories and with different user permissions
   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful
   - Test updating an already-exported task
   - Verify bidirectional linking works correctly
   - Test the round-trip workflow with modifications in GitHub

4. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test with missing GitHub credentials
   - Test with invalid repository names
   - Test with rate-limited API responses
   - Test with very large tasks and content
   - Test with special characters and formatting in task content
   - Verify behavior when GitHub is unreachable

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure export time for different task sizes
   - Test batch export of multiple tasks
   - Verify system handles GitHub API rate limits appropriately
